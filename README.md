# jobit

Terminal-based job application tracker because I don't like GUIs.

## Overview

`jobit` is a personal, offline-first job application tracker built as a terminal user interface (TUI).

It’s designed to be:
- keyboard-driven
- simple
- fast
- flexible

The goal is to replace spreadsheets or Notion with a tool that lives entirely in the terminal and adapts to how *you* want to track applications.

## Core Ideas

- Local-first: data is stored locally
- Schema-driven: you define the fields you care about
- Terminal-native: no mouse, no browser, no GUI
- Opinionated simplicity over feature bloat

## Status

Early development.
